            <p>I've had a desire to learn to code since high school. I found myself trying to learn from time to time,
                but could never put enough hours in for it to make sense or stick. Once I got the chance to go back to school
                I decided to finally join the CS program at North Idaho College. I will be graduating with an associate degree in Spring 2025, 
                and will eventually complete my bachelors with University of Idaho.

            <p>When I'm not glued to my computer screens, you can find me at any EDM concerts in the area or out on a hike with my Kendama.
                My cat, Dexter, is the most high maintenance cat you'll ever find.  
                He was one of the reasons I wanted to get into Computer Science, since "remote work" is becoming more common and available.

                <p>This is a tkinter Python program used to rename Movie and TV Show files.
                    The program allows the user to set specific delimiters and options, like including episode titles. 
                    This is also using the OMDb API to pull exact names of Movies and Episode titles.
                    This program is still a work in progress.

                <p>Supercat JoyGlide was a group project with two other classmates.
                    We coded this game in C++, each handling different aspects of the game.
                    This was intended to be a Jetpack Joyride clone with some free online sprites. 
                    While this was a group project, my main contribution was adding and animating the sprites/backgrounds,
                    writing the main game loop, and consolidating our code to make it more organized and readable. 
                    The biggest challenge behind this project was working with
                    two other people with different coding styles.</p>

                <p>This is a Tic Tac Toe game coded in C language. The best feature in this program is the AI of the computer.
                    It's alway's checks for blocking and winning moves before taking it's turn. This makes it arguably harder 
                    to play against than a real human player.
